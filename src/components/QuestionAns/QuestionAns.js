        <h4>How does React works?</h4>
        <p>
          React is a javascript library , ReactJS divides the UI into isolated
          reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work
          similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs
          called properties or props. It's possible to have as many components
          as necessary without cluttering uor code.
